# healingcommunities
Our group created an app for tackling police brutality, homelessness, as well as connecting essential health services to underserved communities.  This app will not only empower the users by giving them  opportunities to help persons in distress, but will also give members of the undeserved communities direct access to the following services: mental health, women health, shelter, child, food assistance and elderly care. We also believe this app will have a direct effect on reducing police brutality on nonviolent related incidents. There are occasions where we witness individuals acting erratically. With this app we can become the good Samaritan by reporting the person of concern before the police have to intervene, thus deescalating a potential violent police encounter. The good Samaritan has the opportunity of reaching out to mental health services to help a person undergoing mental duress.  The good Samaritan has a litany of communitiesâ€™ resources at their fingertips. Our intention is to empower the everyday person into becoming an agent of good and helping fractured communities heal.
